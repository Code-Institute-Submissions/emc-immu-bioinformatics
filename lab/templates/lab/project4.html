      <h2>CD8 T cell exhaustion model</h2>
      <p class="container intro">
        Exhaustion is a dysfunctional state of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTL) observed in chronic infection and cancer.
        Current in vivo models of CTL exhaustion using chronic viral infections or cancer yield very few exhausted CTL,
        limiting the analysis that can be done on these cells. Establishing an in vitro system that induces CTL
        exhaustion could therefore greatly facilitate the study of this phenotype.

      <p class="container results">
        Purified TCR transgenic OT-1 CTL from mice were cultured with cytokines and were repeatedly stimulated with
        SIINFEKL peptide. After harvesting cells on day 5, inhibitory receptors (IRs) and cytokine production were
        assayed by flow cytometry. RNAseq was performed with the sorted cells. Differential expressed genes, Principle
        Component Analysis (PCA), Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were
        performed with the data.
        Multiple inhibitory receptors, PD-1, Lag3, Tim3, TIGIT, CD244 and CD160 were highly upregulated and co-expressed
        on the repeated
        peptide stimulated cells than the cells without or with single stimulation. Repeated peptide stimulation also
        impaired function of CTL as production of IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α was dramatically reduced, polyfunctionality was
        greatly diminished.

      <p class="container-fluid conclusions">
        Repeated stimulating CTL with the specific peptide, induced all the functional, phenotypic and transcriptomic
        characteristics of exhausted CTL. They express multiple IRs and lose proliferative capacity and
        polyfunctionality.
        The transcriptional pattern of these cells is close to that previously described for exhausted CTL.
